# Asteroids

## Introduction

Asteroids is a web application that uses data from Nasa's NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service) API and Three.js to render an interactive 3D visualization of close to Earth space rocks.

Users can input any date covered by the API allowing for over 70,000 possible scenes. Clicking on an asteroid locks the camera to the asteroid and presents details about the asteroid, including an occasionally alarming 'potentially hazardous' status.
